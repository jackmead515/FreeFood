Specializing in team building and creating database, Middleware, Web (SOA & SAAS), and IT Management products, Ron turns new architectural possibilities into products with real value.\n\nRon has B.S. (Honors, Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi) and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from Iowa State University where he also worked as an IBM Mainframe Systems Programmer. Then, moving to Silicon Valley and joining his first startup, Molecular Design, as their first Computer Science trained employee among 60 chemists, Ron was able to improve performance of their landmark organic chemical database by 3 orders of magnitude. Taking note of his success, former IBM Executive and ISU Alumnus Bob Evans recruited Ron to Foothill Research where he had the honor to work closely with Evans and his portfolio companies and Japanese partners. Moving on to Gupta Corp, which pioneered the PC client/server revolution, Ron and his team created the first multi-database middleware, SQL-Net.\n\nIn 1994, Ron co-founded NetSource, one of the first large website creation companies, and originated, documented, and taught the now commonplace website creation methodology. More recently as head of development at Keynote Systems, a performance management services company, Ron has architected and implemented a massive distributed platform with over 1,500 measurement servers in 50 cities worldwide, feeding 50M+ data points per day to a unique real-time data warehouse. More recently, Ron has provided business strategy, requirements gathering, product design, product marketing, project management, and technical advice to clients in the SOA, SAAS, database, cloud, and media server spaces.\n\n \n\nThanks!"
